Hi :wave:  

My name is **Shantam**. This blog will contain my attempts to replicate/emulate the visualizations at large media houses, related to COVID-19 pandemic, using open source data & tools.

I am a driven **python** developer and **data scientist**. I have experience with **Machine Learning** and **Big Data** as well. Did I tell you I am a published **poet** too?  

I am available for **consulting**, **collaborations**, **part time** or **full time** jobs. Let me know if you want to talk.

If you want me to try a specific visualization, do let me know by raising an issue in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/armsp/covidviz).
